= deadSwap =

deadSwap is a clandestine offline file sharing system. It is
easy to use, but will only work as expected if used correctly,
the instructions in this manual will make you a real deadSwap 
secret agent.


= the secret agent's lexicon =

Becoming a super-spy isn't easy, like any undercover
operation, most of the functionality of deadSwap depends on the
participants doing it right. Learn the terms in this manual well 
and play your role as intended for best results.


== The Drop ==

The data being shared by deadSwap is all carried on a USB Memory Stick,
that is passed around by the participants in the network from one to 
another.

This stick is called "The Drop"

On The Drop are files and directories for sharing data, and also a Wiki
for posting messages for other participants.


== The Gateway ==

The participants co-ordinate the passing-on of The Drop by sending 
SMS (Text) messages to The Gateway. Each deadSwap network has it's
own Gateway, which has a number to send texts to, you must know the
number of your Gateway to participate so when you are told it, store
it in your phone.

All messages sent by participants are sent to the Gateway and all 
messages received are received from the Gateway. 
Participants do not know each other's mobile numbers.

The only way you will be able to know that a message you receive is
from a deadSwap participant is because it will come from The Gateway. 


== rabbits, sleepers and agents ==

deadSwap participants are always playing one of three roles: The rabbit,
the sleeper, and the agent.

A participant is a RABBIT if they DO NOT have The Drop. To get The Drop 
the rabbit sends an SMS to The Gateway. This message should be subtle 
and covert, something like "I want to play," or "Want to meet?" It should 
not mention deadSwap, nor should any files be offered or requested.

A participant is a SLEEPER when they DO have The Drop but HAVE NOT received
any messages from The Gateway yet. The sleeper waits and does nothing 
until a message is received. The sleeper can, of course, because they 
have The Drop, read and post messages on the Wiki, browse the available 
files and directories, upload new files, and copy the files they want 
to keep. The Sleeper should never send any messages to The Gateway, 
they must wait to receive one.

The participant is an AGENT when they DO have The Drop and HAVE received a 
message from The Gateway. Having received a message, they are no longer a 
sleeper, but now an agent with an assignment: Deliver The Drop. The message they 
received will be from a rabbit, the content of this message is not important, 
whatever it says, it means the agent should deliver The Drop to this rabbit. 
The agent should send one response containing instructions for the rabbit,
the instructions can be where the rabbit should wait for the agent, if
the agent will personally deliver The Drop, or where the rabbit can find 
The Drop if the agent will leave it somewhere for them. The instructions 
should be clear, so the rabbit knows what to do. If the Rabbit responds with 
any questions the agent must also respond to these. It is crucial the agent 
responds to each message the rabbit sends, and also it is crucial they only send
one response to each message and never more than one. 

Once the Agent has responded to the each of rabbit's messages and delivered 
The Drop, the agent is retired and has no further responsibilities. They can 
now re-enter the network as a rabbit by sending a message to The Gateway.

Once the rabbit has received The Drop the rabbit is now a sleeper, and should not
send any further messages to The Gateway, not even to thank the agent, nor to 
confirm that The Drop has been received.

The success of the network depends on the competence and diligence of 
the participants.


= deadSwap network advantages =

deadSwap is particularly useful in situations where a private and difficult to
discover and monitor network is desired and/or a where Internet availability 
is difficult.


= open deadSwap networks =

Open deadSwap networks exist for entertainment and training purposes, because 
using deadSwap is a fun way to share and communicate, these networks should not 
be considered clandestine and are intended to be a training ground for novice 
secret agents to perfect their skills. Open deadSwap networks are listed on 
deadSwap.net and any interested party is welcome to participate. 

Even with open networks, competence and diligence in performing the roles 
correctly is essential. To be covert and as difficult to detect as possible, 
deadSwap SMS messages contain no special control commands, and thus The 
Gateway only know the location and destination of The Drop when the 
participants carry out the roles correctly.

It is strongly recommended to begin particpating in an open deadSwap network
as soon as possible. When difficult social conditions impose the necessity of 
employing a deadSwap network the chances of discovery, data loss, or 
miscommunication are reduced when the participants are already seasoned deadSwap
secret agents.


= setting up a new deadSwap network =

The Software to run a deadSwap network can be acquired from deadSwap.net as a live 
USB memory stick, when a computer is booted from this USB stick it becomes 
The Gateway. For the Gateway to function, a mobile telephone with an active SIM must
be attached to it with a data cable. The number to send messages to this SIM is
The Gateway SMS number that all messages are sent to and recieved from. The operators
of the network must ensure that the SIM has sufficient credit to send messages. This
number must be made known to other particpants.

Once The Gatway is set up, the operator can download an empty Drop from deadSwap.net,
copy the contents to a USB stick, and become an initial sleeper agent.

Operators of open networks should send details to bildungsamt@deadswap.net

rabbit        A participant who does not have the drop
sleeper       A participant who has the drop, but has not received a message
agent         A participant who has the drop and has received a message

rabbit    follow received instructions and collect The Drop
sleeper   wait, keep The Drop safe
agent     give rabbit instructions and deliver The Drop

ROLE      GATEWAY INTERACTION RULES
rabbit    send 1 message, reply to received messages only if necessary
sleeper   send no messages, wait  
agent     send 1 (only 1) reply each time a message is recieved 

If any deadSwap network should attract unwanted attention from authoroties, all 
partcipants should maintain that deadSwap is just a game in the tradition of urban 
role playing and artistic explorations of social geography, and also never reveal 
any information regaring other participants.
